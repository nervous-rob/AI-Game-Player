# AI Game Player

A real-time AI game-playing system that captures game frames and uses machine learning to optimize gameplay strategies.

## Project Overview
This system is designed to:
- Capture game frames in real-time
- Process game data efficiently
- Use machine learning models for gameplay optimization
- Simulate game inputs based on AI decisions

## Setup Instructions

1. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
