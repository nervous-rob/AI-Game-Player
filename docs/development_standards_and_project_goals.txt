# Development Standards and Project Goals

## Project Goals
1. **Create a Real-Time AI Game-Playing System:**
   - Capture game frames and simulate inputs in real time.
   - Leverage machine learning models to optimize gameplay strategies.

2. **Develop Modular and Scalable Components:**
   - Ensure each module (e.g., game interface, data processing, machine learning core) is independent and reusable.
   - Maintain scalability for handling various game genres and complexities.

3. **Optimize Performance:**
   - Achieve low-latency frame processing and input simulation.
   - Minimize GPU and memory usage to maximize system efficiency.

4. **Implement Robust Monitoring and Analytics:**
   - Track performance metrics (e.g., FPS, latency, resource usage) in real time.
   - Provide visual dashboards for debugging and optimization.

5. **Ensure Maintainability and Extensibility:**
   - Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
   - Provide configuration files to customize system behavior without code changes.

## Development Standards

### General Standards
1. **Version Control:**
   - Use Git for version control with descriptive commit messages.
   - Follow a branch naming convention: `feature/<feature-name>`, `bugfix/<issue>`, `release/<version>`.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Document all modules and functions using comments and docstrings.
   - Maintain up-to-date project-level documentation in markdown files.

3. **Code Reviews:**
   - Conduct code reviews for all pull requests.
   - Focus on readability, performance, and adherence to standards.

4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for critical functions and modules.
   - Use mock data where applicable for integration testing.

### Python Standards
1. **Style Guide:**
   - Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
   - Use tools like `flake8` and `black` for code linting and formatting.

2. **Type Hinting:**
   - Use type hints to clarify function arguments and return types.

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Use a `requirements.txt` file to track Python dependencies.
   - Pin specific dependency versions to ensure reproducibility.

### C++ Standards
1. **Style Guide:**
   - Follow Google C++ Style Guide conventions.
   - Use `clang-format` for consistent formatting.

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Prefer smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) over raw pointers.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Use exceptions for error handling in critical failures.
   - Log errors and provide clear error messages.

4. **Build System:**
   - Use CMake for build configuration and dependency management.
   - Organize the project into logical directories for headers and source files.

### Machine Learning Standards
1. **Model Architecture:**
   - Define models using PyTorch with clear separation of layers and functions.

2. **Training:**
   - Use logging to monitor training progress and save checkpoints periodically.
   - Validate the model with test data before deploying it in the system.

3. **Inference:**
   - Optimize models for inference using techniques like TensorRT or ONNX runtime.
   - Ensure compatibility with the real-time system requirements.

### Monitoring Standards
1. **Telemetry:**
   - Track key metrics like frame processing time, inference latency, and resource usage.

2. **Dashboard:**
   - Provide interactive visualizations using Streamlit or similar tools.

### Deployment Standards
1. **Containerization:**
   - Use Docker to containerize the application.
   - Separate development and production configurations.

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - Store sensitive information and configuration parameters as environment variables.

3. **CI/CD:**
   - Automate testing and deployment pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

## Collaboration Tools
1. **Issue Tracking:**
   - Use GitHub Issues or Jira for tracking tasks and bugs.

2. **Communication:**
   - Use Slack or Microsoft Teams for team communication.

3. **Code Hosting:**
   - Host the repository on GitHub or GitLab with proper access controls.

By adhering to these standards and goals, this project will ensure high-quality outcomes, maintainability, and scalability for future enhancements.
